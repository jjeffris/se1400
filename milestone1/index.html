            <p>The Renegade Raider skin in Fortnite debuted in Chapter 1, Season 1, as part of the game's early battle pass offerings.
                It was part of the "Shop" section and was available exclusively for players who reached Level 20 in the battle pass, making it one of the first rare skins.
                Over time, Renegade Raider became highly sought after due to its scarcity, as it was never re-released in the Item Shop after its original run.
                The skin's rugged, tactical look, featuring a helmet and goggles, made it stand out as a symbol of early Fortnite nostalgia.
                Today, it’s regarded as one of the most iconic skins, representing the game's beginnings and the rare, exclusive content of its first seasons.
